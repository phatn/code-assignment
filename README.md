#A1
#Optimization
* Move all behaviors into an AnimalBehavior interface
* Change Animal into an abstract class and implements AnimalBehavior to provide default behaviors
* Bird class will extends Animal and override specific behavior if needed

#A2
* Add two subclasses of Bird and define say and swim behavior
* Duck can say and swim
* Chicken can say only, so swim method does nothing
